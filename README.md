# Microshell

## Premise

The goal was to create simple Linux bash program using C language. The program's main feature is having a console that will allow a user to input command which then will be processed according to their content.

## Specificaitons

The program displays {path} $ prompt sign, where the path displayed is current working directory. Additionally it has custom written commands: cd, exit, help, cp and mv. Additionally it can process each command included within PATH environment variable using forking. Naturally it displays error message when the command cannot be processed. On top of everything it has custom prompt colors, it displays currently logged username, has basic quotation marks arguments validation and commands history.

## Additional information

This project was created by me from October 2020 until January 2021 using C language.
